## Summary 

We studied a business problem related to bike sharing services. We
started by presenting some of the main visual techniques in data analysis, such as
bar plots, scatter plots, and time series visualizations. We also analyzed customer
behaviors based on different time frames and weather conditions. We introduced the
reader to hypothesis testing and some of its main applications. Finally, we presented
the basics of time series analysis, and how to identify the best time series models
when dealing with nonstationary time series.
In the next chapter, we will proceed with our analysis by presenting some of the
commonly used data transformation techniques, topics from probability theory, and
further techniques in hypothesis testing
